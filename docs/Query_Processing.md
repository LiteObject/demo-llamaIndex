## Query Processing

Query processing is a critical step that bridges user queries with the indexed data and the language model. Here's a more detailed explanation of the query processing stage:

1. Query Interpretation:
   - The system analyzes the user's query to understand its intent and key components.
   - It may involve natural language processing techniques to parse the query.

2. Query Embedding:
   - Similar to document chunking, the query is converted into a vector embedding.
   - This allows for semantic similarity comparison with the indexed data.

3. Retrieval:
   - The system searches the index for relevant information based on the query.
   - Different retrieval methods are used depending on the index type:
     - For vector indexes: similarity search is performed.
     - For keyword indexes: keyword matching is used.
     - For tree indexes: traversal algorithms are employed.

4. Relevance Ranking:
   - Retrieved chunks are ranked based on their relevance to the query.
   - Factors like semantic similarity, keyword matches, and metadata can influence ranking.

5. Context Window Selection:
   - The most relevant chunks are selected to form a context window.
   - This window size is often limited by the LLM's maximum input size.

6. Query Transformation:
   - The original query might be reformulated or expanded to better match the retrieved context.

7. LLM Prompt Construction:
   - A prompt is constructed for the LLM, typically including:
     - The original or transformed query
     - Retrieved context
     - Any additional instructions or constraints

8. Response Generation:
   - The constructed prompt is sent to the LLM for processing.
   - The LLM generates a response based on the query and provided context.

9. Post-processing:
   - The system may refine or format the LLM's response.
   - This can include fact-checking against the original sources or adding citations.

10. Feedback Loop:
    - User feedback or interaction might be used to refine future query processing.

This process ensures that user queries are answered using the most relevant information from the indexed data, leveraging the power of the LLM to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses.
